## Git

- [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

### Add Git repo from local to an online service

[This approach is also good, if you want to use an existing Git repo,
but you don't want to fork it, but yout want keep the Git history
(tested with GitHub)]

- Create Git repo at the online service
- Init a new Git project or clone an existing repo locally
- Set online service: `git remote (add|set-url*) origin <url-remote>`
- Add to online service: `git push -u origin master`

*Use `set-url` for cloned Git repos
